# Welcome to Bruce Shu's repo!
## About me
Simple and honest, generally an easy-going guy :blush: . <br />
Being fond of anime, games(especially Genshin Impact), interested in play basketball (but not very good at it :sweat_smile:). In Japanese, guys like me are so called *Otaku*. <br />
Graduated from **Sichuan University** in 2021, and major in Leather Chemical and Industry.

## Opinion on SuperX
Being so lucky to have an opportunity to join `SuperX program` carried out by **Thoughtworks**, which is definitely a chance for fellas like me to make a career transition from other fields to `IT`. <br />
I am grateful for SuperX, TW.

## The way to a brand new IT career
A little hard but also full of fun.<br />
Just to IT! <br />
Just do it!
